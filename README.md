As a part of our System Practicum Mini-Project, our team, is setting up a server to host various apps created by students of IIT Mandi on different platforms like
- LAMP
- Ruby on Rails, Django
- Node.js

The idea is to keep all these platforms in seperate containers and allow sudo access within these containers to the students.
